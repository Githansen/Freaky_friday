				As you can see from the pictures, this is a simple room with only a bedroom and a bathroom. 
					It's our cheapest room, but the standard is still high. From this room, you can see Big Ben.
				Our customers appreciate the simplicity of our room. London is a big city, and you usually don't have 
				time to sit in your room if you want to explore the city efficiently.

					<h3>Bathroom </h3>
				<p> The bathroom is unfortunately not optimal for wheelchair users, and you might need assistance

						Please leave a comment when you book this room so we can do fix this for you. <br>
